# Music-Recommendation

With the rise of digital content distribution, we now have access to huge music collections. With millions of songs to choose from, we sometimes tend to get overwhelmed with finding what to listen to. Thus, an efficient music recommender system is necessary.
For this project I used two different kinds of datasets. 
- The Kkbox dataset which consist of metadata of each unique user and with the target variable being whether the user has had recurring listening events within a month
- The Spotify Dataset consists of information about the songs and genres themselves measuring things such as valence, danceability etc. with the target variable being popularity.
